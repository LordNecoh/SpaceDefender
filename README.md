Here you can find a small "SpaceInvaders-like" game I made for the last mission of Unity's Junior Programmer Pathway.
That mission's task was to make a game to show padronance of the Object Oriented Paradigm princples.
Even if it's not clear by this repo's Github percentages, an important part of the project are the C# script, which is the only language in which coded the game.

Inside this repo, you can find all the files needed to open the game in Unity and a PDF describing the project.
Everything is made in english language.

In case anyone doesn't have Unity Editor and is interested to see a build of the project, feel free to contact me.
